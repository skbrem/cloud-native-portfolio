      <h3>Featured Architecture: This Website</h3>
      <p>This portfolio is a live demonstration of my cloud and CI/CD capabilities. It features a fully automated pipeline built with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> that deploys static assets directly to an Amazon S3 bucket in the Cape Town region (af-south-1). Content is distributed globally via <strong>CloudFront</strong>, utilizing strict Origin Access Control (OAC) to ensure least-privilege security.</p>
